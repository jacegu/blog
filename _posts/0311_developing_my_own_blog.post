Developing my own blog

The beginings of my pet project: developing my blog using a custom blogging engine with Ruby, Sinatra and Heroku.

%p As you may have noticed I haven't been writing much last week and a half. I'm sorry but I will write a little less from now on. The reason was <a href="http://twitter.com/ialcazar/statuses/48497615737864193">leaked a few days ago</a>...

%p I have started a new project:  <b>developing my own blog from scratch</b>.<!--more-->

%p I know It might sound like reinventing the wheel. Actually there is a little bit of that. But, since I'm planning to give <a href="http://twitter.com/jacegu/statuses/45580626623078400">a twist to the blog</a> and I have been looking for a pet project for a while this felt like a good opportunity.

%p The blog is a Ruby application that uses <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">sinatra</a> and is deployed on <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>. This way I'll stop "borrowing" hosting from<a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/patoroco">@patoroco</a> and have one on my own.

%p The idea is pretty similar to <a href="https://github.com/cloudhead/toto">toto</a>: <b>blog posts will be files published through Git</b> (geeky huh? :·P). No dabatabase. No backend. Just that.

%p I'm using this project to play around with a few Ruby technologies that I'm actually loving: <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">HAML</a>, <a href="http://blog.plagelao.com/2011/03/sass-is-so-cool.html">Sass</a>, and, of course, <a href="http://cukes.info/" target="blank">Cucumber</a>. I wanted to put the full BDD cycle in practice. And, I have to tell you, it's kind of hard and requires discipline.

%p I will also add some Javascript, CSS3 and even HTML5 to the mix eventually.

%p After a week or so I have almost finished the posting feature. I have the look and feel of the blog ready (it is almost a clone from the wordpress theme I'm currently using but 100% written by my). I also have the <a href="http://jacegu.heroku.com">app working on Heroku</a> with a hard-coded showcase post.

%p When the project is a little bit more stable I will release it. Now it's more or less a spike.

%p I'll keep telling you how the project goes and what happens with what I have published on this one. In the meantime, keep reading ;·)
